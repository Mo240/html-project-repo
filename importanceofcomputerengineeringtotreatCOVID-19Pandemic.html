    <h2>Importance of computer engineering to treat COVID-19 Pandemic</h2>
    <body>
    One of the symptoms of the coronavirus . Artificial intelligence tools are also being deployed to better understand the biology and chemistry of the coronavirus and pave the way for the development of effective treatments and a vaccine. For example , start up benevolent artificial intelligence says its artificial intelligence derived knowledge graph of structured medical information has enabled the identification of a potential therapeutic . Benevolent artificial intelligence concluded that the drug baricitinib , which is approved for the treatment rehumatiod arthritis , could be of use in countring covid 19 infections subject to appropriate clinical testing . The pandemic has led enterprise software company Salesforce to diversify into life sciences , in a study demonstrating that artificial intelligence model can learn the language of biology , just as they can do speech and image recognition . The idea is that the artificial intelligence will then be able to design proteins , or identify unknown proteins , that have specific properties which could be used to treat covid 19 . Salesforce fed the amino acid sequences of proteins and there associated metadata into its progen artificial intelligence system . The system takes its each training sample and formulates a game in which it tries to predict the next amino acid in a sequence . By the end of the training , progen has become an expert at predicting the next amino acid by doing artificial intelligence . But in all this cases , artificial intelligence is only effective if it has sufficient examples to learn from . As covid 19 has taken the world into unchartered territory . In the face of covid 19 , many caregivers and engineers and gifted amateurs are stepping up to find ways to support healthcare workers . To help guide some of these efforts , Michael barrow , is a doctor who candidate with professor Ryan kastner 's research group in the computer science and engineering department at United States san Diego is leading an effort to boost critical care management during this uncertain times . And doctors in all over the world try to find a medicine for this dangerous disease.
