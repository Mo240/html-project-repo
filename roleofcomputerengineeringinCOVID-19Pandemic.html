    <h2>Role of computer engineering</h2>
    <body>
        The computer engineering is playing an important role to help in the process of treatment this disease . The computer engineering has many tools to help in many different ways . They are being  used
to predict the spread of the the coronavirus ,map its genetic evolution as it transmits from human to human , speed up diagnosis and in the development of the potential treatment while also helping policymakers cope with related issues such as the impact on transport and food supplies and travel  . But in all this cases the artificial intelligence is very important and very effective if it has sufficient examples to learn from . As covid19 has taken the world into unchartered territory ,the deep learning system which computer use to acquire new capabilities do not necessary have the date they need to produce useful outputs . Deep learning is good at predicting generic behaviour , but is not very good at extrapolating that to a crisis situation when almost everything that happens is new . And if people react in new ways the artificial intelligence cannot predict it . Untill you have seen it, you can not learn from it . And the artificial intelligence is very important to help covid 19 and help people in its sickness . It is also the case that artificial intelligence based diagnostics that are being applied in related areas can quickly be repurposed for diagnosing covid 19  infections . The urgent need to understand the kinds of policy interventions are effective against covid 19 have driven various governments to quickly award research grants to harness artificial intelligence . The information derived from the news reports will be combined with other date such as covid 19 case reports ,to gave policymakers and health authorities a much more complete picture of how and why the virus is  spreading differently in different countries .
