    <h2>The role of scientists towards the role of computer engineering to stop COVID-19 pandemidc</h2>
    <body>
        In the face of covid 19 , many caregivers and engineers and gifted amateurs are stepping up to find ways to support healthcare workers . To help guide some of these efforts , Michael barrow , is a doctor who candidate with professor Ryan kastner 's research group in the computer science and engineering department at United States san Diego is leading an effort to boost critical care management during this uncertain times . And doctors in all over the world try to find a medicine for this dangerous disease. So that they developing a telemedicine platform is called TV covid 19 and designed to enhance hospital wide communication in a crisis and help medical specialists care for more patients . Clinicians with the most acute care experience can focus on the sickest patients while having a telecommunication conduct to advise their colleagues.  This way technology can multiply expertise . Acute care specialists can't possibly monitor all patients but their knowledge can easily be shared with other clinicians . The platform gaves patients the ability to selectevly allocate their attention where its needed most . This empowers front line practitioners of all backgrounds with the real time exportise on how to care for their critically ill patients . It also reduce exposure to infected individuals to prevent the spread of the dangerous disease covid 19 . So that the computer engineering is very important to help sick people in this disease by using artificial intelligence and awarene anyone in all over the world to deal with this dangerous disease. So that we should not deny the role of the computer engineering that do it to help people in their disease by using the artificial intelligence and we can save the number of deaths in all over the world  and to save the States from any danger that face them again and protected them from disasters
